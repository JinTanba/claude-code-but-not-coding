    "thumbnail_design_detail": "Image resources and usage:\n- base_diagram.png: the supplied dark diagram (use as background texture only)\n- eth_chip.png: custom graphic of a small 'chip' showing a 3‑byte hex id (example: 0xA1B2C3) — create vector version\n- globe_nodes.png: stylized node graph / globe with radiating AI nodes (vector)\n\nWorld view / concept / atmosphere:\n- Convey a single clear idea: tiny deterministic IDs (3 bytes) + Ethereum finality = global shared context for AI. The thumbnail should read as a technical, credible announcement with a surprising twist: \"so little data can align every AI.\" Atmosphere: high‑tech, authoritative, slightly provocative.\n\nHow images should be used (classification & processing):\n- Classification: Minor Adjustments\n- Use base_diagram.png as a dimmed, blurred background texture (opacity ~15%) to preserve original concept but remove small unreadable details.\n- Place eth_chip.png centered-right as the focal point, scaled large enough to be legible even at 300px width. Apply subtle drop shadow and neon cyan rim glow to increase contrast against dark background.\n- Place globe_nodes.png behind the chip with reduced opacity to imply global reach and many AI nodes referencing the chip.\n- Color-correct icons to align with the palette (ethereum indigo / electric cyan / accent orange) and increase saturation/contrast for mobile readability.\n\nText content to appear on the thumbnail (kept minimal):\n- Primary headline (max 2 lines): \"World Context Protocol\"\n- Secondary punchline (one short line): \"Ethereum → World Context Machine\"\n- Technical hook (small, monospace badge): \"Deterministic 24‑bit SemID (3 bytes)\"\n- Small footer line (tiny): \"SemID = CREATE2(keccak256(golay(bin(embedding))))\"\n\nDetailed design specifications:\n- Canvas and export sizes: deliver 1200×675 (primary), 1600×900 (high-res), and 300×169 (small)\n- Background: #0b0f18 near‑black with faint circuit/grid texture from base_diagram.png at 15% opacity, gaussian blur 6px\n- Primary accent colors: Ethereum indigo #3C3CFF (main icon), electric cyan #00E6FF (glow/lines), accent orange #FF6A3D (callouts)\n- Typography:\n  - Headline: Inter Black or Gilroy Bold, white #FFFFFF, 56–72px (depending on export), letter-spacing -0.5px, line-height 0.95. Limit to 2 lines.\n  - Subtitle/punchline: Inter SemiBold, #C9D6E6 (light cool gray), 24–32px, margin under headline 12px.\n  - Technical badge: IBM Plex Mono or Source Code Pro, 18–20px, background rounded rectangle fill #071025 at 65% opacity, text color #00E6FF or #FF6A3D.\n  - Footer phrase: Inter Regular, 12–14px, muted gray #7f8b98.\n- Layout:\n  - Top-left: Headline and subtitle block, left aligned, 8% from left edge, 10% from top.\n  - Middle-right: eth_chip.png (focal), occupying ~36% of canvas width, vertically centered. Chip contains big monospace hex \"0xA1B2C3\" with subtle bevel.\n  - Behind chip: globe_nodes.png to suggest network; node connection lines colored electric cyan with small dot highlights.\n  - Bottom-left corner: small footer and the technical badge stacked.\n- Visual motifs: subtle coordinate grid or compass lines faintly radiating from the chip to emphasize 'shared coordinate' idea. Use thin lines (1–2px) in cyan with low opacity.\n\nRationale for viral success:\n- Instant Value: Headline directly states the product name and the bold claim (Ethereum acts as a context layer), so viewers immediately know the news.\n- Specificity: Small monospace badge displays \"Deterministic 24‑bit SemID\" which signals technical meat; people in technical/crypto communities respond strongly to concrete numbers and primitives.\n- Novelty/Paradox: Visual focus on a tiny 3‑byte ID (chip) juxtaposed with a global node graph creates a cognitive dissonance—\"how can 3 bytes do that?\"—which drives clicks.\n- Emotional Triggers: The design balances reassurance (blockchain finality, credible fonts/colors) with surprise (small ID, Golay reference). The neon accents produce excitement and modernity.\n- Curiosity Gap: The monospace code line and the formula invite developers to learn how embedding+Golay+coding yields deterministic SemIDs; the thumbnail promises a satisfying technical explanation.\n- Credibility: Use of technical snippets (model name in supporting lines if space allows), cryptographic function name and 24‑bit callout builds trust; Ethereum color cues associate with an established protocol.\n- Simplicity: The layout is uncluttered; one bold idea + one visual metaphor + one technical hook. This makes the message memorable and easy to share.\n\nOptional variants:\n- Social square (1:1) crop: put chip in center, headline above, badge below. Increase font sizes for readability on mobile feeds.\n- Text‑only dark mode for newsletters: headline + small chip icon + one‑line hook.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Ensure all text is outlined/flattened before export to avoid font substitution.\n- When reusing base_diagram.png, remove tiny labels and re-create any needed labels in vector text to ensure legibility.\n- Produce an export with and without the small formula badge — A/B test which has higher CTR among developer vs general crypto audiences.\n\nHow this drives impressions and engagement:\n- The combination of a bold conceptual claim, a surprising quantitative hook, and clear technical markers attracts both broad crypto/AI audiences and specialist communities (researchers, devs), increasing shareability across Twitter/X, Hacker News, Reddit, and LinkedIn.\n- Legible, high‑contrast thumbnail optimized for mobile will improve click-through rate and impression retention in crowded feeds.\n- A/B testing the small-code badge and accent color (cyan vs orange) will let editorial teams iterate quickly for maximum virality."
