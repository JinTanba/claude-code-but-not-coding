  "thumbnail_design_detail": "Image resources and usage:\n- /images/portrait_video_headshot.jpg (provided): use as a human credibility element; crop to right-third vertical bust. Apply a subtle duotone overlay in brand accent (teal/aqua) and mild softening to reduce overly-identifying detail while keeping approachability.\n- /images/anthropic_logo_black.png (provided): place as a white/low-opacity lockup in the top-right or bottom-right corner for brand recognition.\n\nWorld view / concept and atmosphere:\n- \"Breakthrough Intelligence — Human + Machine\": minimal, confident, slightly cinematic. Dark, high-contrast background with a focused human portrait to signal leadership and trust. Big, bold headline that reads instantly on small screens. Accent color for urgency and CTA.\n\nHow images should be used (classification + processing):\n- Classification: Minor Adjustments.\n  * Logo: Utilize as-is (high-quality). Convert to white or 85% white on dark background for legibility. Keep safe clear-space and no distortion.\n  * Portrait: Minor adjustments required — crop, color-correct, apply duotone (teal accent), reduce skin contrast slightly, add subtle vignette and drop-shadow. Avoid naming the person in overlays and do not call out identity in copy.\n\nAll text content to appear on the thumbnail (prioritized for legibility on mobile):\n- Primary headline (very large): \"CLAUDE OPUS 4.1\"\n- Primary subhead (large, one line if possible): \"Most capable model — reasoning + advanced coding\"\n- Secondary line (small): \"Also: Claude Sonnet 4 — high performance & efficiency\"\n- CTA pill (small, high-contrast): \"Try Opus 4.1 • claude.ai\"\n- Brand lockup: \"ANTHROPIC\" (logo) in corner\n\nDetailed design specifications:\n- Canvas/aspect: 16:9 (1200 x 675 px export); create additional 1:1 (1080 x 1080) and 9:16 (1080 x 1920) crops.\n- Background: deep charcoal black (#050505) with subtle radial gradient to center-left where text sits.\n- Portrait treatment: place on right 40% column; apply duotone gradient overlay from top-right teal (#00B6A0) to bottom-right translucent black; opacity ~30-40% to preserve facial cues.\n- Headline typography: Inter Black or Helvetica Neue Condensed Heavy; all-caps or Title Case; white (#FFFFFF); tracking tightened slightly; font-size huge so text remains readable at thumbnail sizes (approx 48–64px in 1200px canvas scale).\n- Subhead typography: Inter SemiBold; sentence case; white with 85% opacity; font-size ~22–28px.\n- Secondary line: Inter Regular; smaller, 14–18px; 70% white opacity.\n- CTA pill: rounded rectangle bottom-left, accent color teal (#00B6A0) or electric blue (#2BC4FF), white bold text inside. Add small chevron icon optionally. Drop shadow slight for separation.\n- Logo placement: top-right or bottom-right; white, 32–48px height; 12–16px margin from edges.\n- Spacing & composition: left 60% reserved for text; large negative space above headline to allow breathing room; ensure safe area so headline isn't cropped on mobile.\n\nAccessibility & platform considerations:\n- Ensure minimum contrast ratio for headline vs background >= 7:1.\n- Test thumbnail at small preview sizes (120 x 67 and 200 x 112) to confirm headline legibility — if needed, shorten headline to \"CLAUDE OPUS 4.1 — New Thinking Engine\".\n\nRationale for viral success:\n- Instant Value: the headline immediately names the product and version (Opus 4.1) and states the benefit (reasoning + coding).\n- Specificity: uses exact model names (Opus 4.1, Sonnet 4), brand (Anthropic), and CTA (claude.ai) to reduce friction and increase credibility.\n- Novelty/Paradox: \"most capable and intelligent model yet\" paired with both reasoning and coding — counters the old trade-off and creates intrigue.\n- Emotional Triggers: aspirational (build smarter apps), FOMO (\"next‑gen is here\"), and reassurance (brand + developer resources visible).\n- Curiosity Gap: visual headline + subline prompt the question \"How much better?\" and drives clicks to the release and demos.\n- Credibility: Anthropic logo, portrait (human element), and explicit links/resources included in subtext increase trust and sharing potential.\n- Simplicity: bold, minimal composition and short, punchy text make the message memorable and scannable across feeds.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- For press/social variations, create a short animated GIF or MP4 (6–8s): fade-in headline, slide-in CTA, subtle portrait zoom. Motion increases impressions in feeds.\n- Provide alternate thumbnails: one fully brand-led (logo centered, headline only) and one product-led (portrait + headline) to A/B test CTR.\n\nThis design balances trust (brand + human) with a high-contrast, curiosity-driving headline optimized for social feeds to maximize impressions and engagement."
