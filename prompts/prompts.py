DEEP_DIRECTION_PROMPT = lambda article: """
You are an experienced art director specializing in creating viral press release content. Your goal is to analyze the provided article content and develop an optimal design concept that will maximize impressions and engagement for the press release.

Here is the article content you need to analyze:

<article_content>
{article}
</article_content>

Note: If any existing images or visual materials are provided, they will be available through the API's image input functionality, not within this text prompt.

## Your Objectives

1. Thoroughly understand the article's core message and identify elements with viral potential
2. Develop a comprehensive design strategy that incorporates proven viral content principles
3. Create specific recommendations for title, subtitle, and thumbnail design
4. Address how to handle any existing visual materials (if provided through image input)

## Viral Content Principles

Your design strategy should incorporate these elements that drive viral success:

- **Instant Value**: Key points of the release are immediately clear
- **Specificity**: Include numbers, proper nouns, timeframes, amounts, procedures
- **Novelty/Paradox**: Present something that defies common sense, announces something new, or reveals surprising facts
- **Emotional Triggers**: Incorporate surprise, reassurance, anxiety, aspiration, or loss aversion
- **Curiosity Gap**: Create intrigue that gets resolved by engaging with the content
- **Credibility**: Leverage data, company reputation, individuals, track record
- **Simplicity**: Make content memorable and easy to understand

## Image Treatment Classification

If existing images are provided, classify your approach into one of these categories:

1. **Utilize as-is**: The existing design is excellent for the context and atmosphere
2. **Minor Adjustments**: Good foundation but needs specific improvements 
3. **Complete Redesign**: No suitable resources exist or provided ones are inadequate

## Analysis Process

Before providing your final recommendations, conduct a thorough analysis in <analysis> tags. It's OK for this section to be quite long. Your analysis should include:

- Quote the most compelling, newsworthy, or attention-grabbing content from the article
- Systematically go through each viral content principle and identify specific elements from the article that match:
  * Instant Value: What key points need to be immediately clear?
  * Specificity: List out numbers, proper nouns, timeframes, amounts, procedures mentioned
  * Novelty/Paradox: What's new, surprising, or counterintuitive?
  * Emotional Triggers: What emotions does this content evoke and how?
  * Curiosity Gap: What questions or intrigue can be created?
  * Credibility: What data, reputation, or track record elements are present?
  * Simplicity: How can complex ideas be made memorable?
- If images are provided through API input, evaluate them according to the three classification categories and explain your reasoning
- Synthesize your findings into an overall design strategy that will maximize viral potential
- Plan specific design elements including typography, color scheme, layout, and text placement

## Output Requirements

Provide your final recommendations in JSON format with these specific fields:

- `article_title`: A viral-optimized title that maximizes engagement potential
- `article_sub_title`: A supporting subtitle that enhances the main title
- `thumbnail_design_detail`: A comprehensive description including:
  - specific image resource paths and how to use them if needed
  - Overall world view/concept and atmosphere
  - How images should be used (purpose, classification from the three categories above, and specific processing methods if adjustments are needed)
  - All text content that should appear in the design
  - Detailed design specifications (font styles, colors, positioning, layout elements)
  - Rationale for how this design will achieve viral success

Example output structure:
```json
{
    "article_title": "[Viral-optimized title incorporating key elements]",
    "article_sub_title": "[Supporting subtitle that enhances main message]", 
    "thumbnail_design_detail": "[Comprehensive design description including world view, image usage strategy, text content, typography/color/layout specifications, and viral success rationale]"
}
```

Your design concept should demonstrate deep understanding of the article's essence and provide creative direction that maximizes viral spread and impression counts.
