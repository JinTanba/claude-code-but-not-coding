    "thumbnail_design_detail": "image resource paths: \n- provided_diagram.png (use as conceptual base, see 'Minor Adjustments')\n- assets/ethereum-logo-vector.svg (center ledger/compass)\n- assets/semid-badge-orange.svg (create 3-byte badge visual)\n- assets/icons/stake.svg, assets/icons/rewards.svg, assets/icons/agent.svg, assets/icons/ipfs.svg\n\nOverall world view / concept / atmosphere:\n- Concept: 'Shared coordinate system' — Ethereum at the center as a ledger/compass that multiple AI agents and knowledge providers point to. The atmosphere should be modern, slightly futuristic, with high trust (crypto/infra) cues and a hint of technical rigor (monospace formula). The visual mood is authoritative yet intriguing — invites clicks from both crypto and AI audiences.\n\nHow images should be used & classification:\n- Classification: Minor Adjustments. The provided_diagram.png communicates the idea but is low-contrast and not thumbnail-optimized. Use it as a compositional reference and rebuild at high resolution.\n- Processing: Vectorize central elements. Replace small unreadable labels with large, flat icons and short text. Increase contrast and change background to deep slate (#0B0F14). Recolor icons to match palette (Ethereum gradient + accent orange). Crop to multiple aspect ratios (1:1 for social feed, 16:9 for article hero).\n\nText content to appear on the thumbnail:\n- Main headline text (very large): \"World Context Protocol\"\n- Secondary bold line (medium): \"Ethereum → AIの共通文脈レイヤ\"\n- Badge text (prominent icon): \"24‑bit SemID\"\n- Micro-teaser (monospace, small): \"CREATE2(keccak256(golay(bin(embedding(sentence)))))\"\n- Micro-icons with labels (tiny, legible): \"Deterministic\" | \"Staking & Slashing\" | \"Demand-driven Rewards\"\n\nDetailed design specifications:\n- Canvas sizes: Primary social thumbnail 1200x1200px (1:1). Secondary hero 1600x900px (16:9).\n- Background: deep slate gradient (left #0B0F14 → right #0F1720). Subtle radial vignette behind Ethereum logo to focus attention.\n- Focal composition: Centered Ethereum logo vector (size ~34% width) with soft glow in Ethereum gradient (indigo→cyan). Place SemID badge (3-byte orange rounded rectangle) overlapping lower-right quadrant of the Ethereum logo (~12% of width) with a small drop shadow.\n- Headline typography: Inter Bold or Sora Bold, uppercase for clarity. Size: 72–90px (1:1), responsive to crop. Color: white (#FFFFFF) with 1px subtle dark stroke to keep legibility on glow.\n- Subtitle typography: Inter SemiBold, 34–42px, color #D7EFFF (pale cyan). Place directly under headline with 12–18px spacing.\n- Formula typography: JetBrains Mono or IBM Plex Mono, 16–20px, color #9FBEDC, placed top-right or bottom-left as a curious easter-egg. Slight semi-transparent black pill behind text for legibility.\n- Badge styling: Rounded rectangle, background #FF6A3D (orange), heavy white monospace digits \"24‑bit\" inside (JetBrains Mono Bold) with subtle inner shadow. Add small label under badge: \"SemID\" in uppercase microcaps (Inter ExtraBold, 12–14px).\n- Icon row (bottom or right column): 3 icons (stake, rewards, agent) evenly spaced, each with a single-word label (Deterministic / Staking / Demand-driven). Icons colored with Ethereum gradient for outline and filled with light cyan. Labels in Inter Regular, 14px, color #E6F7FF.\n- Visual pipeline hint: a thin curved arrow from a paper/document icon (left) into Ethereum logo, and arrows from Ethereum outward to multiple agent icons (right). Each arrow includes a tiny label: \"embed → SemID → reference\". Arrow color: soft cyan (#4FD1C5) with 2px stroke.\n- Contrast & legibility: ensure minimum text size at small preview (for feed thumbnails, headline remains legible at 128px width). Use strong weight and ample letter spacing for headline.\n\nRationale for viral success:\n- Instant Value: The headline + \"24‑bit SemID\" badge immediately conveys what WCP does and its surprising numeric specificity. Readers know right away the release is about Ethereum + AI context IDs.\n- Specificity: Visual callouts (24-bit, model name in article, staking, L2/L1) and the technical formula satisfy technical audiences and journalists looking for facts to quote.\n- Novelty/Paradox: The design highlights the paradoxical choice of small 24-bit IDs and re-purposing Ethereum, provoking curiosity and debate — good for shares and replies.\n- Emotional triggers: The centered Ethereum ledger visual conveys authority/reassurance; the orange \"24‑bit\" triggers surprise; icons for staking/rewards tap into aspiration (new jobs/rewards) and security (slashing).\n- Curiosity Gap: The monospace formula on the thumbnail acts as a hook for technical viewers to click and learn 'how it works'. The short headline raises the question 'how can a 24‑bit ID work?' prompting engagement.\n- Credibility: Use of Ethereum logo, crisp icons (stake/rewards), and monospace formula increases perceived technical rigor. The thumbnail uses specific, verifiable claims (24‑bit, deterministic) to build trust.\n- Simplicity: Visual metaphor (compass/ledger + badge) reduces complex concept to an easy-to-grasp image. Minimal text and clear iconography make it memorable in feeds.\n\nDeliverables & variants:\n- Variant A (engagement-first): Large headline, large SemID badge, formula hidden; optimized for social feeds and non-technical audiences.\n- Variant B (tech-first): Smaller headline, visible formula, pipeline mini-graphic, emphasis on model name and Golay — optimized for Hacker News, Twitter X, LinkedIn technical posts.\n- Asset package: layered PSD/FIG file with editable headline, subtitle, badge color; SVG icons and high-res PNG exports for each aspect ratio.\n\nHow this will maximize impressions and engagement:\n- Eye-catching central symbol (Ethereum) plus a bold, surprising numeric badge (24‑bit) create immediate visual hooks in crowded feeds.\n- Clear technical cues (monospace formula, icons) draw in crypto/AI communities who are likely to reshare and discuss, amplifying reach.\n- Two optimized variants cover both mainstream and technical audiences, increasing cross-platform virality.\n- The design balances credibility and intrigue so journalists and community members can quote specifics while ordinary readers are intrigued enough to click."
