    "thumbnail_design_detail": "Image resources and usage:\n- resource/main.jpg — use as the hero photo. Crop and process per steps below. (Classification: Minor Adjustments)\n\nOverall concept / world view / atmosphere:\n- A hyperpop × punk pop visual: edgy, high-contrast, neon-tinged, slightly noisy/analog. The thumbnail should communicate paradox: \"fake smile\" vs real emotion — immediate curiosity and emotional punch. The camera-with-mouth motif in the supplied photo is the hero emotional hook.\n\nHow to use the supplied image (purpose & processing):\n1. Cropping: create two safe crops from resource/main.jpg — primary square 1:1 (social feed/thumbnail) centered on the eyes and the camera screen; secondary 16:9 for wide placements. Ensure the camera screen is clearly visible and roughly centered-lower part of the frame.\n2. Color grading: split-tone — cyan highlights (#00E5FF) and hot magenta shadows (#FF2D95). Slightly desaturate skin on one side to create 'real vs fake' split (left side vivid, right side slightly desaturated). Increase clarity and contrast around the eyes and the camera screen. Add 8–12% film grain.\n3. Effects: add subtle horizontal glitch/scanline overlay (low opacity) and a light halftone texture on the background to convey noise. Add a faint vignette to focus on eyes and screen.\n4. Retouching: sharpen eyes and the camera screen region; increase saturation of the mouth on the screen to make the text/teeth legible. Preserve natural look of face — do not over-smooth.\n\nText content to appear on the thumbnail (exact wording):\n- Primary headline (large): ニセモノ smilin\n- Secondary line (medium): MANON\n- Badge (high-contrast): 9/19 RELEASE\n- Event strip (small): PINK NOISE — 9/20 ENTER SHIBUYA ¥2,000\n- Tiny credibility line (optional if space): Spotify \"Hyperpop\" pick · prod. knoak\n\nDesign specifications (fonts, colors, positioning, layout):\n- Canvas: produce 1:1 at 1600×1600 px and 16:9 at 1920×1080 px. Keep safe margins 10% from edges.\n- Typography:\n  - Headline (Japanese + romaji mixed): use a bold condensed Gothic / Sans JP Black (e.g., Noto Sans JP Black or equivalent). All-caps roman parts in a condensed display.\n  - Accent/Distressed: for small punky words (e.g., PINK NOISE) use a slightly distressed stencil/display font to evoke punk energy.\n  - Credibility line: small sans (Noto Sans / Helvetica Neue) at 10–12pt.\n- Colors:\n  - Primary accent cyan: #00E5FF\n  - Secondary accent pink: #FF2D95\n  - Badge background (release): hot pink #FF2D95 with white text\n  - Event strip background: semi-opaque black (rgba(0,0,0,0.6)) with hot-pink or white text\n  - Headline text color: white (#FFFFFF) with 3px near-black (#000000) outline/stroke and 12% drop shadow.\n- Layout:\n  - Top-left: place Primary headline (ニセモノ smilin) large, stacked if needed. Keep to 2 text lines max.\n  - Directly under or overlapping lower-right of headline: small \"MANON\" tag in cyan with thin white stroke.\n  - Top-right corner: circular badge or rounded rectangle: \"9/19 RELEASE\" (white text on hot-pink) — visually urgent.\n  - Bottom-left strip (small): black semi-opaque bar with \"PINK NOISE — 9/20 ENTER SHIBUYA ¥2,000\" in white; the price highlighted in hot-pink.\n  - Bottom-right corner (tiny): credibility icons/text — Spotify icon (small) then \"Hyperpop pick\" and \"prod. knoak\" (keep very small so it doesn't clutter).\n- Visual treatments to ensure legibility at thumbnail size:\n  - Headline minimum font-size such that the kana/romaji remain legible at 1600→200 px scale.\n  - Apply strong stroke (2–4 px depending on size) and slight backdrop glow to separate text from busy photo.\n\nRationale for viral success:\n- Instant Value: the thumbnail immediately communicates artist + new single title + release date via large headline and release badge. Viewers can tell at a glance what, who, and when.\n- Specificity & Credibility: release date (9/19), event date (9/20), price and venue are visible; small credibility row signals Spotify pick and known producer, boosting trust.\n- Novelty/Paradox & Curiosity Gap: the striking visual of a mouth displayed on a camera in front of an otherwise neutral face creates an immediate \"what's going on?\" question, prompting clicks. The split-tone \"real vs fake\" color treatment visually dramatizes the song's theme.\n- Emotional Triggers: close-up eyes and an exaggerated screen-smile evoke surprise, discomfort, and rebellious energy — perfect for shareability and strong emotional reaction.\n- Simplicity: layout limits text to the essentials (title, artist, release date, event) so messaging reads instantly even at small sizes.\n- Feed standout: the cyan + hot-pink palette is high-contrast and uncommon enough to pop in algorithmic feeds, increasing impressions and stops-scrolling.\n\nDeliverables checklist:\n- 1 x 1600×1600 px thumbnail (finalized PNG/JPG sRGB)\n- 1 x 1920×1080 px wide version\n- Source PSD/Layered file with organized layers (photo, color grade, glitch overlays, headline, badges, event strip, cred line)\n- Export notes: create a low-quality preview 300×300 px to test legibility before posting.\n\nOptional variants (A/B test suggestions):\n- Variant A: headline at bottom-left, camera-screen mouth more saturated and centered — tests headline placement.\n- Variant B: no event strip, larger cred line (for editorial placements where event is irrelevant).\n\nThis design will maximize impressions by combining a uniquely intriguing hero image (provided), bold readable messaging, and platform-optimized colors and badges that create urgency and curiosity while maintaining credibility."
