  "thumbnail_design_detail": "Image resource usage:\n- /images/portrait.jpg (provided portrait) — use as spokesperson crop on right side (classification: Minor Adjustments).\n- /images/anthropic_logo.png (provided wordmark) — use in lower-right corner on a dark bar (classification: Utilize as-is).\n\nWorld view / concept / atmosphere:\n- Modern, confident enterprise-tech look that signals both credibility and breakthrough innovation. Minimalist, high-contrast composition so the thumbnail stands out in feeds. Emotional tone: aspirational + slightly urgent (try now/FOMO).\n\nHow images should be used and processing:\n- Portrait (/images/portrait.jpg): crop to right third of frame, show head-and-shoulders with slight rightward offset so gaze leads into the headline. Apply minor exposure lift (+8%), reduce background saturation, gaussian blur on background wardrobe/closet lines to remove distraction, add subtle teal color grade overlay (3–6% opacity) to harmonize with accent color. Do not identify the person or use any name on the design.\n- Logo (/images/anthropic_logo.png): keep monochrome, place on a 10% opacity black bar across bottom-right or bottom-left depending on balance. Size to be clearly visible but subordinate to headline.\n\nPurpose / classification summary:\n- Portrait: Minor Adjustments — humanizes the brand, builds trust.\n- Logo: Utilize as-is — brand anchor and credibility marker.\n\nAll text content to appear in design (exact strings):\n- Headline (primary): \"Claude Opus 4.1 — The Most Capable AI for Complex Reasoning & Advanced Coding\"\n- Headline badge (attention magnet): \"Opus 4.1\" inside a cyan rounded pill placed top-left of the headline.\n- Subtitle (supporting): \"Plus Claude Sonnet 4: high‑performance reasoning & efficiency\"\n- CTA badge (small): \"Try it at claude.ai →\"\n- Microline (optional small): \"Developer Console · API · Cookbook · Vision\"\n\nDetailed design specifications:\n- Canvas: 1200 x 675 px (16:9) for cross-platform social thumbnail.\n- Safe margins: 60 px from edges for headline and CTA to avoid cropping on previews.\n- Layout: Two-column composition — left 55% for text on a dark-to-transparent gradient background, right 45% for portrait. Bottom-right small logo on a thin dark bar.\n\nTypography:\n- Headline font: Inter / Helvetica Neue Bold, all caps for keywords only (e.g., \"OPUS 4.1\" may use caps), weight Heavy. Size ~56–72 px (scaled for canvas) with tight leading for mobile legibility.\n- Subtitle font: Inter / Helvetica Neue Medium, sentence case, size ~22–28 px.\n- CTA badge font: Inter SemiBold, 16–18 px.\n- Microline font: Inter Regular, 12–14 px, desaturated gray.\n\nColor palette:\n- Background: Very dark graphite / near-black (#0A0A0A) on left pane.\n- Accent (primary): Electric cyan (#00C2FF) for Opus pill and CTA accents.\n- Headline text: White (#FFFFFF) for max contrast.\n- Subtitle text: Light gray (#D0D7DD).\n- Logo: Anthropic wordmark in dark gray on black bar; ensure legibility but keep subordinate.\n\nVisual hierarchy & effects:\n- Use a cyan rounded pill for \"Opus 4.1\" to create an immediate focal point and specificity. Place this at the start of the headline.\n- Headline should be bold, left-aligned, and occupy the top-left area. Subtitle sits beneath with slightly reduced opacity.\n- Portrait should have a subtle drop shadow and soft vignette on the right edge to separate it from the dark text panel.\n- Add a faint diagonal gradient (top-left to bottom-right) behind text to add depth and guide the eye.\n\nAccessibility & mobile optimizations:\n- Ensure headline remains legible at 320 px width — test cropping to center-left.\n- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for headline over background.\n\nRationale for viral success:\n- Instant Value: Headline immediately states what Claude Opus 4.1 delivers (reasoning + advanced coding) so users know the benefit at a glance.\n- Specificity: Calls out exact model names and versions (Opus 4.1, Sonnet 4) and includes the direct CTA (claude.ai) to convert curiosity to action.\n- Novelty/Curiosity Gap: \"Most capable\" claim plus a prominent version pill forces viewers to ask \"what's new?\" — driving clicks.\n- Emotional Triggers: Human portrait builds trust; bold claims and 'Try it now' CTA create aspiration and FOMO among developers and decision-makers.\n- Credibility: Featuring the Anthropic wordmark and subtle developer microline (Console · API · Cookbook · Vision) reassures technical audiences.\n- Simplicity: Clean two-column layout, minimal text, and a single clear CTA make the message scannable and memorable.\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Export variants: 1200x675 for Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn, 1080x1080 square crop for Instagram (keep portrait & headline centered), 1280x720 for YouTube thumbnails.\n- A/B test two headline variants: (A) the recommended headline above and (B) a curiosity-first variant: \"How Smart Can AI Get? Meet Claude Opus 4.1\" to measure CTR lift.\n- Keep all source layers (portrait mask, logo, headline, badge) editable for localization (Japanese/English) and future version updates."
