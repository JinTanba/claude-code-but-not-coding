    "thumbnail_design_detail": "Image resources and usage:\n- /images/headshot.jpg (provided) — Use as the left-third portrait element (classification: Minor Adjustments).\n  - Processing: crop to tight 4:5 framing, center on face (no identification). Increase exposure +8, clarity +6, subtle warm tone; apply 12% vignette to darker corners. Add 2px electric-teal (#00E5C4) outline to separate from background.\n- /images/anthropic_wordmark.png (provided) — Use as brand lockup (classification: Utilize as-is).\n  - Processing: create white inverted version and 40% opacity black/white background watermark.\n\nOverall world view / concept and atmosphere:\n- Theme: \"Trusted next‑gen AI for developers\" — professional, authoritative, slightly futuristic.\n- Mood: confident, inviting, and curiosity-driving — mix of high-contrast dark brand base with a vivid tech accent (electric teal or purple) to convey innovation.\n\nHow images should be used (purpose and classification):\n- Headshot (Minor Adjustments): humanizes and reassures; positioned left to create immediate trust. Do not claim identity. Use processing above and subtle drop shadow for separation.\n- Wordmark (Utilize as-is): reinforces credibility; place as subtle background element behind headline or bottom-left lockup.\n\nAll text content to appear on thumbnail:\n- Main headline (large): \"Claude Opus 4.1\"\n- Supporting line (medium): \"最も高度な推論とコーディング能力\"\n- CTA badge (small): \"Try claude.ai\" (arrow icon)\n- Microcopy (tiny, optional): \"Text · Code · Vision — Developer Console & API\"\n\nLayout and positioning (recommended safe area for social feeds):\n- Canvas aspect ratio: 16:9 for social/video thumbnails; prepare 1:1 crop variant for feeds.\n- Left 30%: tight portrait of person (face at 1/3 vertical). Ensure eyes at upper third.\n- Right 70%: stacked text block aligned left with breathing space.\n  - Top-right: small, semi-transparent Anthropic wordmark watermark centered behind text at 40% opacity.\n  - Middle-right (headline): \"Claude Opus 4.1\" — extremely large, bold numeric treatment so \"4.1\" reads as the visual hook.\n  - Below headline: supporting line \"最も高度な推論とコーディング能力\" in medium weight.\n  - Bottom-right: CTA badge \"Try claude.ai\" in filled electric-teal with white text and arrow.\n- Bottom-left corner (over portrait vignette): full-opacity Anthropic wordmark lockup (small) to reinforce brand.\n\nTypography:\n- Headline: Inter ExtraBold or Helvetica Neue Condensed Bold — large, tight tracking, all caps for \"CLAUDE\" and numeric \"4.1\" emphasized with 1.2x scale and accent color.\n- Subtitle: Inter Medium or Helvetica Neue Medium, sentence case, 14–18pt equivalent for thumbnail.\n- CTA badge: Inter SemiBold, 12–14pt, rounded pill shape.\n- Microcopy: Inter Regular, 10pt, light gray (#BFC7CC).\n\nColor scheme:\n- Background: Anthropic black/dark charcoal (#0B0B0B)\n- Primary accent: Electric teal (#00E5C4) or alternative vivid purple (#7C4DFF) for numeric \"4.1\" and CTA.\n- Headline text: White (#FFFFFF)\n- Subtitle text: Light gray (#DDE5EA)\n- CTA background: Electric teal (#00E5C4), CTA text white.\n\nGraphic treatments:\n- Subtle diagonal or radial gradient from left (warm/skin tone) to right (cool/teal) to guide eye movement.\n- Thin geometric divider line under headline in accent color.\n- Slight drop shadow (Y 4px, blur 10px, alpha 20%) under headline to improve legibility on busy backgrounds.\n\nAccessibility and legibility:\n- Contrast: Ensure headline meets WCAG AA against dark background. Use white on dark with accent highlights.\n- Text size: large enough to be legible on mobile thumbnails; reduce copy to 2 short lines.\n\nRationale for viral success:\n- Instant Value: The thumbnail immediately communicates a new model name and its claim to be the most capable — users instantly know what’s new.\n- Specificity: Uses exact model name \"Opus 4.1\" and the product destination \"claude.ai\" as a direct CTA.\n- Novelty/Paradox: Visual emphasis on numeric \"4.1\" sits alongside human face and the word \"trusted\" vibe — this suggests surprising capability plus reliability.\n- Emotional Triggers: Human face evokes trust; bold numeric and \"most capable\" wording create FOMO and aspiration for developers.\n- Curiosity Gap: Minimal copy teases advanced reasoning and coding improvements, encouraging clicks to \"learn more\" or \"try\".\n- Credibility: Prominent Anthropic wordmark + developer tool references supply brand authority.\n- Simplicity: Limited lines of copy, clear CTA, and strong visual hierarchy keep the message memorable and scannable.\n\nAdditional execution notes:\n- Produce variants: 16:9 (video), 1:1 (social feed), 9:16 (stories). Ensure headline scales and the face remains visible in each crop.\n- A/B test two accent colors (teal vs purple) and two headline copy options: (A) \"Claude Opus 4.1 — 最も高度な推論\" (B) \"Claude Opus 4.1 — 次世代のコーディングAI\" to measure CTR.\n- Legal/comms: Do not identify the person in the headshot; caption should avoid naming them unless cleared. Keep claims aligned with provided copy: \"most capable\" is allowed as product messaging, but avoid unverifiable metrics like exact speedups unless provided.\n\nThis treatment balances trust (human + brand), novelty (4.1 hook), and direct action (claude.ai) to maximize impressions and engagement across socials and press distribution."
