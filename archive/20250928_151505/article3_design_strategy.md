The SemID badge is a memorable, meme‑able visual anchor (easy to repurpose). Specific technical callouts (24‑bit, deterministic, staking, model names) in the subline and credibility band provide trust signals to technical and Web3 audiences, increasing pickups by influencers and specialist presses. The composition supports multiple crops for platform optimization, ensuring strong impressions across feeds. The visual simplicity (large headline + single iconic badge) maximizes scannability and clickthrough on crowded social channels."
