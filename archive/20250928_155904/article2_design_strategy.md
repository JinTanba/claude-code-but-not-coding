  "thumbnail_design_detail": "Image resources and usage:\n- /images/headshot.jpg (provided headshot) — crop to 4:5 vertical/thumbnail-safe center. Use as 'trust' focal point (left side). Do not identify the person by name in any copy.\n- /images/anthropic_logo.png (provided black wordmark) — use in top-right corner as brand anchor. Keep opacity 90% on dark background or 60% if background is light.\n\nOverall concept & atmosphere:\n- \"Human + Machine Authority\" — Convey powerful technical capability with human trust. The thumbnail should read as: credible brand + breakthrough product (Opus 4.1) + developer-focused benefit, all at a glance.\n- Tone: confident, authoritative, developer-aspirational, slightly urgent.\n\nHow images should be used (classification and processing):\n- Classification: Minor Adjustments.\n- Headshot processing: tight crop on face (shoulders visible), subtle warm desaturation (-10%), +8% clarity, soft vignette at edges to draw focus to face. Slight lift of exposure on face (+10%) and remove background color cast to match brand neutral beige/grey.\n- Logo processing: place on a clean black or deep charcoal panel on the right side. Add subtle inner glow to separate it from background if needed.\n\nLayout and composition:\n- Canvas: 1280 x 720 (16:9) and square 1200 x 1200 variants. Ensure headline legibility at small sizes (use large weight type, high contrast).\n- Split layout: left 55% = headshot block (with left margin), right 45% = dark brand panel for text and logo. On square crop, move face to upper-left and content to lower-right so both remain visible.\n- Visual hierarchy (top → bottom): small brand logo (top-right) → giant version badge \"OPUS 4.1\" (large, bold, right center) → primary claim headline (below or left of badge) → 3-icon micro-benefits row (language, code, vision) → CTA pill button bottom-right.\n\nText content to appear on thumbnail (Japanese):\n- Main badge (very large): OPUS 4.1\n- Primary short headline (large): 最も高度なAI、登場\n- Supporting descriptor (smaller): 言語・推論・分析・コーディング・ビジョン対応\n- CTA pill (small): デモを確認 — claude.ai\n- Micro-cred (tiny, optional): by Anthropic\n\nTypography, color, and styling:\n- Headline font: Inter Bold or Helvetica Neue Black for \"OPUS 4.1\" and primary line. Size large so \"OPUS\" and \"4.1\" dominate.\n- Body/subline: Inter SemiBold or Helvetica Neue Medium. Micro-cred and icons: Inter Regular.\n- Accent font for code/developer cue: IBM Plex Mono or JetBrains Mono (very small) for \"API / SDK\" tags.\n- Colors: background panel = #0B0B0B (near-black), headline white = #FFFFFF, accent = #00D1BF (cyan/teal) for version decimal \"4.1\" or CTA border, secondary accent = #FF8A00 (warm orange) reserved for urgency if needed.\n- Text treatments: OPUS in white, \"4.1\" in accent cyan. Primary claim in bold white. Subline in 70% white (rgba(255,255,255,0.7)). CTA pill: cyan fill (#00D1BF) with white text or white outline with cyan text depending on background.\n- Shadows and separation: subtle drop shadow under text (y:4px blur:12px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)) to maintain legibility on complex headshot edge.\n\nIcons and micro-benefits:\n- Under subline, show 3 small icons (text, code, image) with 1–3 word labels: 言語  •  コード  •  ビジョン. Icons should be minimalist line icons in white or 70% white.\n\nRationale for viral success:\n- Instant Value: The large \"OPUS 4.1\" badge immediately signals a specific new product/version. The short headline communicates the benefit: \"most advanced AI\".\n- Specificity: Uses concrete version numbers (4.1) and enumerates supported modalities (言語・推論・分析・コーディング・ビジョン), satisfying curiosity for developers and decision makers.\n- Novelty/Paradox: Framing as \"最も高度なAI、登場\" creates surprise/importance and invites viewers to learn what changed.\n- Emotional triggers: The human face creates trust and relatability; the bold claim creates aspiration and FOMO for developers; CTA offers immediate action (デモを確認).\n- Curiosity Gap: The thumbnail promises a demonstration and concrete capabilities — viewers will click to resolve \"how much better\" Opus 4.1 is.\n- Credibility: Prominent Anthropic wordmark + version number + developer resource cues (API/Console/Cookbook) reinforce legitimacy.\n- Simplicity: Clean split layout, few words, strong numeric anchor (4.1) ensures readability on social platforms and mobile feeds.\n\nDeliverables & export notes:\n- Produce three crops: 16:9 (hero), 1:1 (social), and 4:5 (Instagram feed). Export at 2x resolution for retina.\n- Provide layered source file (Figma/PSD) with named layers: HEADSHOT, LOGO, BADGE_OPUS41, TITLE_JP, SUBLINE_JP, ICON_ROW, CTA_PILL.\n- Accessibility: include alt text: \"Anthropic Claude Opus 4.1 — 最も高度なAI。言語・推論・分析・コーディング・ビジョン対応。デモを見る claude.ai\"\n\nWhy this will maximize impressions:\n- The combination of a human trust cue + bold product version + short, benefit-driven claims creates high click-through potential on social feeds and news aggregators. Numeric/version emphasis (4.1) is a proven hook that performs well in developer and tech audiences. The clear CTA and visual hierarchy make the message scannable at a glance — critical for high impressions and engagement across platforms."
