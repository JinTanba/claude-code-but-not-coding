  "thumbnail_design_detail": "Image resources and usage:\n- resource_1: provided_diagram.png (the user-supplied dark diagram). Use as the conceptual base — crop and rebuild elements rather than using raw file as-is.\n- resource_2: eth-mark.svg (high-contrast Ethereum glyph). Use centered as the \"ledger hub\" in the visual.\n- resource_3: node-icons.svg (three stylized AI/agent nodes). Use to represent providers and context commits.\n- resource_4: semid-badge.svg (small rounded badge template for microcopy). Create new SVG.\n\nOverall world view / atmosphere:\n- Tone: authoritative, technical, slightly futuristic — credible to devs, designers, crypto and AI audiences.\n- Mood: dark slate background for feed contrast, bright Ethereum teal/blue as trust color, vivid accent (magenta/orange) for AI/attention highlights.\n\nHow images should be used (classification & processing):\n- Classification: Minor Adjustments (retain conceptual diagram but rebuild for legibility).\n- Processing steps:\n  1. Reconstruct the provided diagram at high resolution. Enlarge the central Ethereum glyph and redraw node icons with flat, geometric style. Add soft neon glows on links to imply context highways.\n  2. Increase overall contrast: background #0f1720 (near-black slate), primary Ethereum color #3C9FD8 for main glyph and connectors, accent color #FF5D7A (magenta) for SemID highlights, secondary accent #FF9A3C (orange) for economics/stake badges.\n  3. Create a cropped 16:9 version (1200x675 px) and a square social variant (1200x1200 px). Ensure all text remains legible at mobile thumbnail sizes — enforce minimum headline font-size for small output.\n\nText content to appear on thumbnail (exact strings):\n- Primary headline (large): \"Ethereum as the World’s AI Context Layer\"\n- Secondary subline (smaller): \"Deterministic 24‑bit SemID • Stake‑backed Quality\"\n- Three micro-badges (small rounded chips):\n  1. \"24‑bit SemID\"\n  2. \"Deterministic (client)\"\n  3. \"Demand‑driven Rewards\"\n- Tiny code/tech snippet (very small, used as visual credibility): \"CREATE2(keccak256(golay(bin(embedding(sentence)))) )\"\n\nLayout & composition (precise specs):\n- Canvas: 16:9 primary; safe margins 6% on all sides.\n- Left third: Bold headline stacked in 2 lines, left-aligned. Headline max 6–8 words to fit mobile.\n- Right two-thirds: Stylized diagram — central Ethereum glyph with three glowing connectors to node icons; above the glyph, floating SemID representation: a 3‑byte hex block (example visual: \"SemID: 0xA3 4F C2\") placed in magenta badge.\n- Bottom strip (full width, 12% height): three micro-badges evenly spaced. Each badge has icon + text.\n- Microcopy font sizes: headline at 36–48px (responsive down to 18–22px on thumbnail), subline at 16–20px, badges at 12–14px.\n\nTypography:\n- Headline: Inter Bold (or Neue Haas Grotesk Bold) — uppercase small caps allowed for weight. Tracking -10 to tighten.\n- Subline: Inter Medium or IBM Plex Sans Medium.\n- Code snippet and SemID: IBM Plex Mono or Roboto Mono, small caps effect for hex bytes.\n- Badges: Inter SemiBold.\n\nColor palette (hex):\n- Background: #0F1720\n- Ethereum primary: #3C9FD8\n- Accent (AI/attention): #FF5D7A\n- Secondary accent (economics): #FF9A3C\n- Headline text: #FFFFFF\n- Subline text: #D1E8F8 (light teal)\n- Badge background: semi-opaque #ffffff12 (12% white) with inner stroke in accent color\n\nVisual treatments & effects:\n- Subtle inner glow (outer glow) on connectors to suggest network activity (use eth color).\n- Soft gradient halo behind Ethereum glyph to create focal depth (eth color to transparent).\n- Use thin grid lines or faint embedding-vector motif in background to convey 'coordination' without clutter.\n- Make SemID hex block look like a short, memorable address (3 byte example) — this creates the curiosity gap (\"Why only 24‑bit?\").\n\nRationale for viral success:\n- Instant Value: The headline is explicit about what changes (Ethereum becomes AI's context layer) and the subline summarizes the specific, immediate benefit (deterministic 24‑bit SemID + stake-backed quality).\n- Specificity: We surface technical specifics visually (\"24‑bit SemID\", CREATE2 snippet, SemID hex bytes, staking rewards) to increase credibility and invite expert clicks.\n- Novelty/Paradox: The bold claim (Ethereum used as \"context machine\") and the counterintuitive 24‑bit design choice are presented front-and-center to trigger shares and debate.\n- Emotional Triggers: Visual badges like \"Demand‑driven Rewards\" and \"Stake‑backed Quality\" reassure and inspire professional opportunity; the SemID teaser provokes curiosity.\n- Curiosity Gap: Thumbnail shows the surprising element (24‑bit SemID + Ethereum) but not the full mechanics — users click to resolve how it works.\n- Credibility: Use of a short code string, specific model name (in article header or caption), and Ethereum glyph visually signals technical rigor.\n- Simplicity: Minimal copy, large type, and three micro-badges let viewers grasp the concept in under a second.\n\nDeliverables & export guidance:\n- Provide layered PSD / Figma file with components: headline, subline, Ethereum glyph, node icons, SemID badge, three micro-badges, background pattern.\n- Export variants: 1200x675 (open graph), 1200x1200 (square social), 1280x720 (YouTube), and a mobile-optimized 800x800 thumbnail. Supply 2 brightness variants for light/dark-themed clients.\n\nWhy this will maximize impressions:\n- Strong, specific hook + surprising numeric fact (24‑bit) attracts clicks and shares among both developer and product audiences.\n- Visual credibility (Ethereum glyph, code snippet) increases click-through from technical readers; human-readable micro-badges communicate practical benefits to non-specialists.\n- High-contrast, mobile-optimized layout ensures visibility in feeds, increasing impressions and engagement."
